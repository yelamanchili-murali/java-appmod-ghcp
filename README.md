# Modernising Legacy Java Applications with GitHub Copilot

**Author:** Murali Rao Yelamanchili

This repository contains a comprehensive guide to effective Java application modernisation using AI-assisted development tools, particularly GitHub Copilot Agent Mode. It provides both strategic guidance and practical demonstrations through real-world legacy application modernization journeys.

## How to Use This Guide

This guide is designed to help you apply a structured, AI-assisted approach to modernizing legacy Java applications. Here's how to maximize its value:

### 1. **Start with the Strategy**
Begin by reading through the chapters to understand the foundational principles:
- **Analysis-first approach** for understanding legacy systems
- **Behavioral preservation** strategies to maintain business logic integrity
- **Risk mitigation** techniques for large-scale modernization efforts

### 2. **Apply the Structured Process**
Follow the documented workflow that leverages GitHub Copilot Agent Mode:
- Use the provided **meta-prompts** and **prompt templates** from the appendices
- Apply the **"Reverse then Forward"** methodology for safe modernization
- Implement **incremental validation** at each step of the journey

### 3. **Learn from Real Examples**
**→ See [SAMPLES.md](samples/SAMPLES.md) for detailed repository links and modernization results**

Examine the practical applications across two legacy projects:
- **Spring Framework PetClinic (pre–Spring Boot)** — modernized to Spring Boot 3 + Next.js
- **Java EE Petstore (EE6)** — migrated from JSF + EJB + JPA to Spring Boot 3

### 4. **Leverage AI Agent Mode Effectively**
The examples demonstrate how to:
- Structure conversations with AI agents for complex modernization tasks
- Break down large modernization efforts into manageable, validated steps
- Use AI to accelerate analysis, planning, and implementation phases
- Maintain code quality and behavioral consistency through AI-assisted validation

## Key Focus: Process Over Perfect Outcomes

> **Important:** The primary goal of this guide is **not to demonstrate fully working modernized applications** (which may require several iterations to perfect), but rather to showcase:
> 
> - **The structured approach** to modernization that improves success rates
> - **Effective use of GitHub Copilot Agent Mode** for complex migration tasks
> - **Risk management strategies** that prevent common modernization pitfalls
> - **Documentation and validation practices** that ensure project continuity

## Sample Applications

The guide includes hands-on practice across two representative legacy applications:

- **Spring Framework PetClinic (pre–Spring Boot)** — a classic Spring MVC app
- **Java EE Petstore (EE6)** — a JSF + EJB + JPA sample

**→ Visit [SAMPLES.md](samples/SAMPLES.md) to access the repository links and examine the modernization outputs**

## Getting Started

To begin your modernization journey:

1. **Read the Guide**: Open [SUMMARY.md](SUMMARY.md) and navigate through the chapters
2. **Review the Samples**: Examine the `modernisation` branches in the sample repositories
3. **Apply the Techniques**: Use the provided prompts and methodologies in your own projects
4. **Iterate and Improve**: Adapt the approaches based on your specific modernization challenges
