## How to Use This Guidebook

This demonstration guidebook shows how you might apply a structured, AI-assisted approach to modernizing legacy Java applications. Here's how to get the most from these examples:

### 1. **Explore the Demonstrated Strategies**
Browse through the chapters to see examples of key principles:
- **Analysis-first approach** for understanding legacy systems
- **Behavioral preservation** strategies to maintain business logic integrity
- **Risk mitigation** techniques for large-scale modernization efforts

### 2. **See the Structured Process in Action**
Observe the demonstrated workflow that leverages GitHub Copilot Agent Mode:
- Use the provided **meta-prompts** and **prompt templates** from the appendices
- Apply the **"Reverse then Forward"** methodology for safe modernization
- Implement **incremental validation** at each step of the journey

### 3. **Learn from Real Examples**
**→ See [SAMPLES.md](samples/SAMPLES.md) for detailed repository links and modernization results**

Examine the practical applications across two legacy projects:
- **Spring Framework PetClinic (pre–Spring Boot)** — modernized to Spring Boot 3 + Next.js
- **Java EE Petstore (EE6)** — migrated from JSF + EJB + JPA to Spring Boot 3

### 4. **Leverage AI Agent Mode Effectively**
The examples demonstrate how to:
- Structure conversations with AI agents for complex modernization tasks
- Break down large modernization efforts into manageable, validated steps
- Use AI to accelerate analysis, planning, and implementation phases
- Maintain code quality and behavioral consistency through AI-assisted validation

## 🚀 Getting Started

**Ready to explore? Here's your roadmap:**

1. **📖 Start with the Guide**: Open **[SUMMARY.md](SUMMARY.md)** to navigate through all chapters and appendices
2. **🔧 Explore Real Examples**: Visit **[SAMPLES.md](samples/SAMPLES.md)** to access modernized repositories and examine results  
3. **📝 Adapt for Your Context**: Consider how these demonstrated techniques might apply to your own projects
4. **🔬 Experiment and Learn**: Use these examples as a starting point for your own modernization explorations

## Sample Applications Overview

The guidebook demonstrates approaches using two representative legacy applications:

- **Spring Framework PetClinic (pre–Spring Boot)** — a classic Spring MVC app
- **Java EE Petstore (EE6)** — a JSF + EJB + JPA sample

## Key Focus: Process Over Perfect Outcomes

> **Important:** This guidebook is **not intended to demonstrate fully working modernized applications** (which may require several iterations to perfect), but rather to show:
> 
> - **The structured approach** to modernization that improves success rates
> - **Effective use of GitHub Copilot Agent Mode** for complex migration tasks
> - **Risk management strategies** that prevent common modernization pitfalls
> - **Documentation and validation practices** that ensure project continuity
