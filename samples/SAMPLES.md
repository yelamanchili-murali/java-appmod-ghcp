# Samples

This directory contains documentation and references to sample applications that demonstrate the modernization approaches and techniques outlined in this guide. The samples showcase real-world modernization journeys from legacy Java applications to modern Spring Boot architectures.

## Sample Applications

### Spring Framework PetClinic (pre–Spring Boot)

A classic Spring MVC application that demonstrates modernization from traditional Spring Framework to Spring Boot 3 + Next.js.

**Github Repository:**
- **Original Application**: https://github.com/yelamanchili-murali/spring-framework-petclinic (branch: `main`)
- **Modernization Results**: https://github.com/yelamanchili-murali/spring-framework-petclinic (branch: `modernisation`)

The modernization branch README begins with:
> "This repository documents a comprehensive Spring Framework → Spring Boot 3 + Next.js modernization journey. The migration has been completed successfully with full behavioral preservation and comprehensive documentation."

### Java EE Petstore (EE6)

A JSF + EJB + JPA sample application that demonstrates modernization from Java EE 6 to Spring Boot 3.

**Github Repository:**
- **Original Application**: https://github.com/yelamanchili-murali/agoncal-application-petstore-ee6 (branch: `master`)
- **Modernization Results**: https://github.com/yelamanchili-murali/agoncal-application-petstore-ee6 (branch: `modernisation`)

The modernization branch README begins with:
> "This repository documents a comprehensive Java EE 6 → Spring Boot 3 modernization journey. The migration is in progress with thorough behavioral preservation planning and comprehensive documentation."

## Viewing Modernization Results

To view the results of applying the prompts and techniques outlined in this guide, navigate to the **`modernisation`** branches of each repository. These branches contain:

- Step-by-step documentation of the modernization process
- Code changes with detailed commit history
- Behavioral preservation strategies and validation
- Comprehensive migration documentation

## Tools and Approach

Much of the modernization work demonstrated in these samples was accomplished using **GitHub Copilot Agent Mode with Claude Sonnet 4**, showcasing how AI-assisted development can accelerate and improve modernization outcomes.

## Important Note on Intent

The primary intention of these samples is **not to demonstrate a fully working modernized solution**, but rather to highlight:

- The **process and journey** behind effective modernization efforts
- The importance of having a structured approach to modernization
- Strategies that improve the chances of successful modernization outcomes
- The critical role of behavioral preservation and validation
- Documentation practices that ensure knowledge transfer and maintainability

These samples serve as practical references for understanding how to apply the modernization principles, techniques, and prompts documented throughout this guide in real-world scenarios.
